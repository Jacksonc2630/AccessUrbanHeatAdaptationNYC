# Equitable Access to Urban Heat Adaptation Infrastructure and Heat Vulnerability in New York City

## Project Overview

This research examines how equitable access to urban heat adaptation infrastructure influences heat vulnerability in historically underserved neighborhoods of New York City.

### Methodology

**Composite Heat Vulnerability Index (CHVI):**
- **Heat Exposure**: Measured using Wet Bulb Globe Temperature using simplified Steadman WBGT formula (0.567*T + 0.393*ea + 3.94)
- **Social Vulnerability**: CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to measure community susceptibility to heat-related health impacts
- **Adaptive Capacity**: Access to cooling centers, green spaces, and urban design factors

### Code
Run in this order:
1. **00_Initialization.py** - Setup project structure
2. **01_Preprocessing.py** - Clean and standardize spatial data
3. **02_DataImport.py** - Load all datasets
4. **03_WbgtCalculation.py** - Calculate heat exposure metrics
5. **04_AdaptiveCapacity.py** - Measure infrastructure access
6. **05_CompositeHeatVulnerabilityIndex.py** - Compute social vulnerability
7. **06_Visualization.py** - Create maps and figures
8. **07_SummaryStatistics.py** - Generate final statistics and disparity analysis
9. **08_SummaryStatistics.ipynb** - Generate SVI on NYC map
